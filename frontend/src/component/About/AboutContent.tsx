        Vichaar is more than just a blogging site—it's a project built with
        passion, curiosity, and a deep desire to learn and create. As a student
        exploring full-stack web development, I wanted to build something
        meaningful: a place where anyone can share their thoughts, ideas, and
        experiences with the world.
